# Notes-Taking-App
This is a basic Notes Taking App made using NodeJS allowing the user to create Notes through the terminal commands.

The packages being used are chalk, yargs and nodemon.

[Yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs) package is used for custom designing the commands.

[Chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) package is used for giving visuals to the outputs on the terminal.

This was done as part of the Udemy Online course "The Complete Node.js" Developer Course by Andrew Mead.
